# Nbyula Takeaway Assignment 2

## Mission

Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. With Nbyula
growing exponentially, terraformers are looking forward to expanding
their team. Could you help them build a customizable job board?

## Objectives

- Terraformers and applicants should be able to sign up and login to
  the app
- Terraformers should be able to post a job listing on a common job
  board shared between other terraformers
- The listing should contain: title, description (markdown
  support is a plus), location, deadline, contact phone
  number and contact email
- Note that these job listings should be presented as cards on a
  board
- Based upon how far the job listing is from the deadline, the
  cards should have a color. For simplicity, the listing which
  are due in more than 21 days should be green, less than 14 days
  should be yellow and less than 3 days should be red
- Terraformers should be able to rearrange the cards on the board
  by drag and drop to help them modify the order in which theyâ€™re
  displayed to the applicants
- Terraformers should be able to archive a job listing
